# [SYSC4505] Automatic Control Systems

Review of Laplace transform techniques.
Effects of feedback: frequency response, pole-zero positions.
Compensation: root locus, Bode plots. State variables: formulation, solution of linear systems, examples of simple second-order non-linear systems. Discrete time systems: z-transforms.
Signal reconstruction.
